If you want to give her a loving home please read the entire listing below and reach out to us accordingly.

We will request a deposit of £100 on the day of reservation to ensure our kitten does not miss out on another potential loving home in the mean time. The further £300 will be payable upon collection when the kittens reach 8 weeks old and can leave Mum.

We litter train, wean & flea treat our kittens on the day of collection. We will also give you some of the meat & kibbles that we feed the kittens to help them acclimatise to their new home, surroundings & smells. We also recommend the food that we use but understand there is a lot of choice out there.

Please get your kittens 1st jabs & chip implant done at your earliest opportunity - we recommend Pets at Home.

Our kittens will be available to loving, well prepared homes & families only, please contact us by phone to discuss the kittens potential new home and so we can get to know one another a little.

We are fanatic about cats & are always on hand to give any advice, help or just check in (which we hugely appreciate). Knowing the welfare of the kittens & hearing the joy that they bring to familyÕs is wonderful for us.

The kittens will be available to collect on or after the 31st of May. We will speak with you in regard to preparing for your kitten and the collection procedure we have in place due to the current goings on, along with a check list of things we would like to ensure you have prior to bringing your kitten home.

They love to cuddle. They will come with full starter kit( litter tray, litter , dry and wet food, some toy,and the blanket which will smell their mother to help them feel more comfortable in new place.

The kittens have been handled a lot so they are very friendly and used to people.
